# TMDB-Box-Office-Revenue-Prediction


**The Goal of the Competition**: <br>
Using metadata on over 7,000 past films from The Movie Database, I will predict their overall worldwide box office revenue.

Simplified Version of How to Start with Gradient Boosting Models:
1. Perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset
2. Feature engineering: take the features that you already have and combine them or extract more information
3. Build a quick and dirty model, or a baseline model, which can serve as a comparison against later models that you will build
4. Monitor performance and early stopping for avoiding model fitting issues. Also take a look at feature importance of variables and check 5. whether the variables that you are seeing make sense
6. Tune parameters of models (I usually focus on tuning parameters for Tree Booster, such as eta, max_depth, min_child_weight).
7. Compare different models by metric (ex. RMSE)
8. Get a model that performs better!
